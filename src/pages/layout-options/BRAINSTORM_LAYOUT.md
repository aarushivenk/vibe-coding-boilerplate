# Layout Options for Interface Builder 

## The Goal 
Our goal is to make a clean, user friendly, and intuitive tool for designing functional and beautiful interfaces.

## Users 
Main users will be low code developers. They may have experience with high code tools, or have no coding experience 

## Feedback we've gotten on Layout Options 1 - 9
None of the designs seem perfect just yet. 

The main feedback we've gotten through the designs are as follows: 
- A natural way to monitor what dev copilot is doing is to be able to simultaneously see the expression
- Config pane should not be available when using Dev Copilot
- Try to make rule inputs/local variables look less daunting
- It's okay for palette to be less prominent
- Don't make expression mode experience worse
- Variables should take more vertical space than horizontal space 
- The live preview should be shown at the same time as expression mode 
- Users should always be able to access variables, but hide them if they don't need them
