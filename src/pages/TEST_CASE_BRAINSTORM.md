# Multiple Test Cases and AI Test Cases in Interface Building Experience 

## Problem and User Personas
Low code devs who use our interface builder tool repeatedly report unpleasant experiences during testing. As we continue to make our product robust for AI agents to build interfaces as well, translating requirements into clear, well-defined, and comprehensive test cases is crucial, both for developer sentiment and general development success. 

Key User Personas we want to focus on are: 

1. Low code dev who wants to preview their interface based on different roles to make sure they have content visibility set correctly

2. Low code dev who wants to preview their reusable interface in different contexts

3. Low code dev who wants to know if any of their valid scenarios trigger errors on the interface to make sure that their expression is stable regardless of state of interface

5. AI agent who has user stories/acceptance criteria who wants to build in validation

6. AI agent who is editing an existing interface and wants to make sure 1) nothing gets broken, and 2) new functionality is working as expected

7. Low code dev who doesn’t want to use test cases/doesn’t need to


## User Outcomes 

1. Full test coverage for the scope of the interface  - Test cases aren’t missed that are applicable to my interface

2. Less time to test interfaces, more confidence in outcomes

3. Harder to miss testing and easier to thoroughly test, more stable interfaces

4. Easier to thoroughly test, more stable interfaces

5. Easy to update test cases as a result of changes to requirements

6. Easy maintenance of test cases (identify contradicting logic, missing coverage, etc)

7. For those that don’t need test cases, this shouldn’t make their lives any harder
